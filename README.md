peppercat
============

Dungeons &amp; Dragons style game in the browser.

Peppercat is an implementation of a multiplayer game in a browser using JavaScript, with Python acting as the backend. It makes use of HTML5 Canvas to draw an isometric world, A* to implement player movement and Flask on the backend to implement a routing solution for the different games that would be running at the same time. Each game is hosted in its own thread server-side.
