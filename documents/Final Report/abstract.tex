This report discusses the creation of a game engine that implements isometric graphics, click-based pathfinding movement and multiplayer with multiple running games, hosted in a browser and created with \textsc{html5}, JavaScript and Python with some frameworks.

The report discusses implementation and design details for all the above features, including coordinate conversion, depth sorting and drawing to the screen for the isometric graphics, as well as what isometric is in the context of a game; the creation and following of paths for movement and how those paths are handled when received from remote clients; and how the need for multiple games causes problems in a web-based environment. Particular focus on the server is given to how to create, manage and delete the threads required to run the multiple games; how to route messages to and from these threads and how to connect players to the game in real time on a web platform.
